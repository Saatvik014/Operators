Question)
In the following program, explain why the value "6" is printed twice in a row:
class PrePostDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int i = 3;
        i++;
        System.out.println(i);    // "4"
        ++i;                     
        System.out.println(i);    // "5"
        System.out.println(++i);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i++);  // "6"
        System.out.println(i);    // "7"
    }
}

Answer)"6" is printed twice because after the 7th line value of i becomes 5 and then ++i is used and we know by using prefix
value of i will now become "6" and after that in the 9th line i++ is used, so i was "6" and by using postfix i will remain 6
only, but 7 will be stored in memory and after that in the 10th line increemented value is printed.
